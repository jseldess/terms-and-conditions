Son through which I declare weighted roughly




Opening his eyes


Son
When leaving in a moment
through which I feel roughly

through which I declare



My son has holes in his gradual eyes
Son through which I declare
My boy opening in his eyes
the home for work
for a moment 



When leaving
feel roughly weighted
weighted air 
opening in his gradual eyes


Son has holes in his incremental eyes
My boy has holes in his eyes
through which I d
the home




in a moment
incremental eyes

My son and I 
and waiting



incremental eyes weighted roughly
weighted roughly

in his incremental eyes
Opening in his incremental eyes




through which I feel roughly weighted air

When weighted
My son opening in his gradual eyes
When leaving in a moment the home
Son opening in his incremental eyes
