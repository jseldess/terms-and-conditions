Opening his eyes



My boy opening in his eyes


holes in gradual incremental
for work 



toothpaste
incremental eyes weighted roughly
Weighted air
shoes socks lunch
when leaving



incremental eyes
through which I feel roughly


before the comb hair
Weighted roughly 




Opening in his incremental eyes
opening in his gradual eyes
the home for work
When leaving in a moment the home



Son


My son and I 



When leaving a moment the home
roughly home 
and waiting
feel roughly weighted
books waterbottle
when leaving in a moment
I feel weighted air opening 

for a moment 


through which I feel roughly weighted air
Son through which I declare
in his gradual eyes




Son opening in his incremental eyes



My son opening in his gradual eyes
comfortable roughly  
When weighted
in a moment
