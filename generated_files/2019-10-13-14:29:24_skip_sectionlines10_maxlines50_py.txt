We franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, third-party owners. Most hotels operating under IHGâ€™s brands are independently owned and operated by parties that have entered into a franchise agreement with IHG that allows them to use an IHG brand for the purposes of operating a hotel (referred to as "Franchisees" or "Franchised Hotels"). If you make a reservation through us to stay at an IHG-branded hotel, we will share your information with that hotel. However, as IHG-branded hotels are not owned or controlled by IHG, their use of your information will be governed by their own privacy practices and is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.


Aside from the purposes described above, we do not share your information with any other third parties unless we have your consent or under special circumstances, such as:
