We franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, third-party owners. Most hotels operating under IHG’s brands are independently owned and operated by parties that have entered into a franchise agreement with IHG that allows them to use an IHG brand for the purposes of operating a hotel (referred to as "Franchisees" or "Franchised Hotels"). If you make a reservation through us to stay at an IHG-branded hotel, we will share your information with that hotel. However, as IHG-branded hotels are not owned or controlled by IHG, their use of your information will be governed by their own privacy practices and is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.


Your membership number and pin as well as details of your memberships with any of our programme partners such as our airline or car rental partners;


Information that you may choose to provide in your loyalty profile, such as your personal stay and destination preferences; and


Online Channels

It will also be necessary to transfer this information to third parties, including, without limitation, our Franchisees, partners and third-party service providers.

These parties may set cookies at our direction to help us collect information and provide you with advertisements that we believe would be relevant for you. In some instances these third parties may also assist us by providing certain statistical and analytics information in relation to our marketing practices. We also may share information collected through cookies (and other tracking technologies) with third parties to use for their own analytics and marketing purposes.
